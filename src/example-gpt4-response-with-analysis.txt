## Step-Rating-Analysis
Step 1: """I notice that the problem involves trigonometric functions and arithmetic progressions, so I wonder if there is a connection between them.""" Rating: 0 Analysis: this step points out what the problem involves and leads to probing into the connection between them, so this step is appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies, contains no weirdness, and contains no computations to verify, but fails to substantially advance the process of solving the problem, so it should be rated as 0.
Step 2: """I recall that an arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where each term is obtained by adding a constant amount to the previous term.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step recalls the definition of an arithmetic progression, which is accurate and relevant to the problem. It is also appropriate in conversation and contains no weirdness. The computation is not applicable here, but the information provided helps to advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 3: """I also remember that the sine function is periodic, which means that it repeats the same values over and over again at regular intervals.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step recalls an important characteristic of the sine function, which is accurate and directly relevant to the problem. It's also appropriate in conversation and contains no weirdness. There's no computation to verify in this step, but it advances the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 4: """I wonder if I can use these facts to find a relationship between $\sin \theta,$ $\sin 2 \theta,$ and $\sin 3 \theta.$""" Rating: 0 Analysis: this step is a reflection on the previously mentioned facts and poses a question about how to apply them to solve the problem. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies or weirdness. However, it does not involve any computations and does not advance the solution process, hence it's rated as 0.
Step 5: """I try to visualize what the graph of the sine function looks like, and how it changes when I multiply the argument by 2 or 3.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step involves visualizing the problem, which is a valid and effective approach in mathematics. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies or weirdness, and while there's no computation, it advances the process of solving the problem by providing a way to understand the problem, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 6: """I notice that multiplying the argument by 2 makes the graph oscillate twice as fast, and multiplying by 3 makes it oscillate three times as fast.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step provides an accurate observation about the behavior of the sine function when the argument is multiplied. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 7: """I also notice that the amplitude of the graph stays the same, which means that the highest and lowest values of the sine function are still 1 and -1, regardless of the argument.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step provides another accurate observation about the sine function. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 8: """I think about what it means for three values of the sine function to form an arithmetic progression.""" Rating: 0 Analysis: this step reflects on the problem statement and what it implies. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies or weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does not advance the solution process, hence it's rated as 0.
Step 9: """It means that the difference between any two consecutive values is the same.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step provides an accurate definition of an arithmetic progression in the context of the problem. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 10: """For example, if $\sin \theta = a,$ $\sin 2 \theta = b,$ and $\sin 3 \theta = c,$ then $b - a = c - b,$ or $2b = a + c.$""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step correctly applies the definition of an arithmetic progression to the problem. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and in the computation, for $b - a = c - b$, moving the term $b$ yields $2b = a + c$, which verifies the computation, so it advances the solution process and should be rated as 1.
Step 11: """I wonder if this equation has any solutions for $a, b, c$ between -1 and 1, which are the possible values of the sine function.""" Rating: 0 Analysis: this step reflects on the possible solutions of the equation. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies or weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does not advance the solution process, hence it's rated as 0.
Step 12: """I try to simplify the equation by using some trigonometric identities.""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step proposes a valid approach to solve the equation. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no inaccuracies or weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 13: """I know that $\sin 2 \theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta,$ and $\sin 3 \theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta.$""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step correctly recalls two important trigonometric identities. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and while there's no computation, it does advance the solution process, so it should be rated as 1.
Step 14: """I substitute these expressions into the equation and get $4 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin \theta + 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta.$""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step correctly substitutes the trigonometric identities into the equation. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and the calculations in this step substitute some trigonometric identities into the equation $2b = a + c$ (where $\sin \theta = a,$ $ $\sin 2 \theta = b,$ and $\sin 3 \theta = c$) to get $4 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin \theta + 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta$. sin^3 \theta$, and to verify these calculations, we note that $\sin 2\theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta, \sin 3\theta = 4\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta$, and substituting does give the same result, so the calculations in this step can be verified. By this substition, this step advances the solution process and should be rated as 1.
Step 15: """I divide both sides by $\sin \theta$ and get $4 \cos \theta = 4 - 4 \sin^2 \theta.$""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step correctly simplifies the equation by dividing both sides by $\sin \theta$. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and in the computation, both sides so it advances the solution process and should be rated as 1.
Step 16: """I recognize that $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta,$ so I substitute that and get $4 \cos \theta = 4 - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \theta).$""" Rating: 1 Analysis: this step correctly applies the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta$. It's appropriate in conversation, contains no weirdness, and the computation is simple substitution that can be easily verified, so it advances the solution process and should be rated as 1.
Step 17: """I simplify and get $4 \cos^2 \theta + 4 \cos \theta - 4 = 0.$""" Rating: -1 Analysis: this step simplifies $4 \cos \theta = 4 - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \theta)$ to get $4 \cos^2 \theta + 4 \cos \theta - 4 = 0$, but by expanding the expression and distributing $-4$ on the right side of the equation, we get $4 \cos \theta = 4 + 4 \cos^2 \theta - 4$, then combining like terms on the right side of the equation, we get $4 \cos \theta = 4\cos^2 \theta$, and then isolating $\cos \theta$ on one side by dividing both sides by 4, we get $\frac{4 \cos \theta}{4} = \frac{4\cos^2 \theta}{4}$, which further simplifies to $\cos \theta = \cos^2 \theta$. Therefore, it only looks appropriate in conversation and without weirdness, but contains inaccuracies and the computation is wrong. Thus, it should be rated as -1.
