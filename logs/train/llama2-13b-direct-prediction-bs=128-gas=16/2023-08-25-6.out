[2023-08-25 22:07:01,924] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:133:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)
The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
WARNING:torch.distributed.run:
*****************************************
Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable for each process to be 1 in default, to avoid your system being overloaded, please further tune the variable for optimal performance in your application as needed.
